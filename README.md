# GestuMedia-Control
GestuMedia Control is a gesture-based system control project built in Python. It uses computer vision and hand landmark detection to adjust brightness, volume, mute/unmute, and play/pause media with simple hand gestures.  The project also provides a visual On-Screen Display (OSD) for real-time feedback.
